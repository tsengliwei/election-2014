    NOTE: For now, this is just very basic HTML to show what elements will be on the home page.
          We're looking at having a banner image across the top that will say "Elections 2014",
          then a series of tabs letting the user pick between the elections he/she wants to see,
          then the two candidates directly below that for governor. After the CSS is done, this
          will be a splitscreen view instead of having one candidate below the other, so you'd
          see one candidate and all of his/her details on the left and then the other candidate
          on the right.
